/** @summary Extends an existing constructor into a new constructor.
 *
 * @returns {ChildConstructor} A new constructor, extended from the given context, possibly with some prototype additions.
 *
 * @desc Extends "objects" (constructors), with optional additional code, optional prototype additions, and optional prototype member aliases.
 *
 * > CAVEAT: Not to be confused with Underscore-style .extend() which is something else entirely. I've used the name "extend" here because other packages (like Backbone.js) use it this way. You are free to call it whatever you want when you "require" it, such as `var inherits = require('extend')`.
 *
 * Provide a constructor as the context and any prototype additions you require in the first argument.
 *
 * For example, if you wish to be able to extend `BaseConstructor` to a new constructor with prototype overrides and/or additions, basic usage is:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * var Base = require('extend-me').Base;
 * var BaseConstructor = Base.extend(basePrototype); // mixes in .extend
 * var ChildConstructor = BaseConstructor.extend(childPrototypeOverridesAndAdditions);
 * var GrandchildConstructor = ChildConstructor.extend(grandchildPrototypeOverridesAndAdditions);
 * ```
 *
 * This function (`extend()`) is added to the new extended object constructor as a property `.extend`, essentially making the object constructor itself easily "extendable." (Note: This is a property of each constructor and not a method of its prototype!)
 *
 * @param {string} [extendedClassName] - This is simply added to the prototype as $$CLASS_NAME. Useful for debugging because all derived constructors appear to have the same name ("Constructor") in the debugger. This property is ignored when `extend.extendedClassNames` is set to `false`.
 *
 * @param {extendedPrototypeAdditionsObject} [prototypeAdditions] - Object with members to copy to new constructor's prototype. Most members will be copied to the prototype. Some members, however, have special meanings as explained in the {@link extendedPrototypeAdditionsObject|type definition} (and may or may not be copied to the prototype).
 *
 * @memberOf extend-me

 * @property {object} [aliases] - Hash of aliases for prototype members in form `{ key: 'member', ... }` where `key` is the name of an alieas and `'member'` is the name of an existing member in the prototype. Each such key is added to the prototype as a reference to the named member. (The `aliases` object itself is *not* added to prototype.) Alternatively:
